# IIITD-FINANCE
DPM project - IIITD FINANCE 

Our stock finance website is a one-stop resource for information on companies to invest in. We use Yfinance, Yahoo-Finance, and yahoo-fin Python libraries to retrieve data from Yahoo Finance, and utilize bokeh and plotly to create analytical graphs and candlestick charts, respectively. The website is built using the Python and Flask framework.

On the homepage, users can find a list of company symbols that they can click on to access more information about a particular company. There is also a search bar available to allow users to look up a specific company. Additionally, every time the homepage is loaded, a random candlestick plot for one of the most active companies of the day is displayed, along with the top 5 news stories for the top 5 most active companies at that time. Users can click on "show more" to see additional news stories.

One of the standout features of our website is the stock comparison tool. By searching for two companies that the user is considering investing in, they can view the candlestick plots for both companies in real-time (with a 1 day, 1 minute interval), and compare the daily returns, highs and lows, and moving average filters for each company.

On the details page for a particular company, users can find the current stock price in USD, as well as a candlestick plot for the company (with a maximum data interval of 1 day). The top 5 news stories for the company are also listed. By clicking on the "analyze for me" button, users can access a detailed analysis of the company.
